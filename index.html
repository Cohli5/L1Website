          <h3> Early history of Köenigsegg </h3>
          <p> on August 12th, 1994 the current CEO and the founder of Köenigsegg created the company,
            at the time the young Christian Von Köenigsegg had zero history of car design or manufacturing.<br>
            however he had a passion for performance cars, two years after founding Köenigsegg the first Köenigsegg ever drove.
            the Köenigsegg CC was driven by Rickard Rydell, Picko Troberg, and Calle Rosenblad at Anderstorp race track, 
            the car performed spectacularly and opened up Köenigsegg to possible buyers.<br>

            on the 28th of september, 2000 the first production prototype (the Köenigsegg CC8S ) had its debut at the paris motor show. 
            this very same car was later used as a crash test car to allow Köenigsegg to homologate cars for road usage and sale.<br>

            in 2003 the Köenigsegg workshop and factory in Margretetorp burnt caught fire, it used a thatch roof which Köenigsegg was unable
            to replace due to the buildings heritage status. Luckily no cars were damaged in the blaze however many early records of Köenigsegg 
            were lost to it.
