          <h2> Köenigsegg CCGT </h2>

          <h3> History </h3>
          <p> The Köenigsegg CCGT was a side project for the engineers at Köenigsegg, during the development
            of the first ever production Köenigsegg (the CC) Christian Von Köenigsegg had a large amount of interest
            in the ACO Le Mans regulations and the GT1 class. The Köenigsegg CCGT never got to race however as two 
            months after the CCGT enterered testing the FIA changed the regulations for the GT1 class, this disallowed carbon
            monocoques and minimum production numbers went from 20 cars to 350 cars. This was far out of reach for Köenigsegg
            especially during its early years.
          </p>

          <h3> Performance </h3>
          <p> The Köenigsegg CCGT did not have much horsepower for Köenigsegg. However this was not where it shined
            although the car only had 600 BHP it was extremely light, weighing less than 1000kg and had suspension setups
            tuned to perfectiong allowing for it to handle incredibly well. Infact no Köenigsegg car had handling to the same 
            level as the CCGT up until 2025 when the Sadairs Spear was released.
